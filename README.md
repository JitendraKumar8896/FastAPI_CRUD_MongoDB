FastAPI is a modern, fast (hence the name), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
It's built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

1.Setting Up FastAPI with MongoDB: First, we need to set up our FastAPI project and connect it to MongoDB.
we can use the pymongo library for this purpose.
Install fastapi and pymongo if we haven't already: pip install fastapi uvicorn pymongo

2. Defining Models: FastAPI relies on Pydantic models for request and response validation.
  Define our Pydantic models to represent the data structure of our MongoDB documents.
3.CRUD Operations:

a. Create (POST): Define a route to handle POST requests for creating new documents in MongoDB.
In the route function, you'll receive data from the request body, 
validate it against our Pydantic model, and then insert it into the MongoDB collection.

b. Read (GET): Define routes to handle GET requests for fetching data from MongoDB.
we can have routes to fetch a single document or multiple documents based on certain criteria.

c. Update (PUT or PATCH): Define routes to handle PUT or PATCH requests for updating documents in MongoDB. 
Similar to the create route, we'll receive data from the request body, validate it, and then update the corresponding document in the collection.

d. Delete (DELETE): Define routes to handle DELETE requests for deleting documents from MongoDB. 
we'll typically identify the document to delete based on some unique identifier, such as its ID.

Implementing Routes: Define the routes in our FastAPI application that correspond to the CRUD operations.
Use decorators such as @app.get, @app.post, @app.put, and @app.delete to define the HTTP methods for each route.

Handling Requests and Responses: Implement the logic inside each route function to handle incoming requests,
interact with MongoDB using pymongo, perform CRUD operations, and return appropriate responses.

Running the FastAPI Application: Run our FastAPI application using a web server like Uvicorn.
